Encounter Parameter Space Investigation

=====
We consider the response of a disk perturbed by a flyby object, with a set of different angular velocities and periastron radii using the formalism presented in [Dâ€™Onghia et al. 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010ApJ...725..353D/abstrac). These are derived under the quasi-resonant condition.
